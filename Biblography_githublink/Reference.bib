  abstract = {Random projections have recently emerged as a powerful method for dimensionality reduction. Theoretical results indicate that the method preserves distances quite nicely; however, empirical results are sparse. We present experimental results on using random projection as a dimensionality reduction tool in a number of cases, where the high dimensionality of the data would otherwise lead to burdensome computations. Our application areas are the processing of both noisy and noiseless images, and information retrieval in text documents. We show that projecting the data onto a random lower-dimensional subspace yields results comparable to conventional dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis: the similarity of data vectors is preserved well under random projection. However, using random projections is computationally significantly less expensive than using, e.g., principal component analysis. We also show experimentally that using a sparse random matrix gives additional computational savings in random projection.},

  abstract = {Least-squares Petrov--Galerkin (LSPG) model-reduction techniques such as the Gauss--Newton with Approximated Tensors (GNAT) method have shown promise, as they have generated stable, accurate solutions for large-scale turbulent, compressible flow problems where standard Galerkin techniques have failed. However, there has been limited comparative analysis of the two approaches. This is due in part to difficulties arising from the fact that Galerkin techniques perform optimal projection associated with residual minimization at the time-continuous level, while LSPG techniques do so at the time-discrete level. This work provides a detailed theoretical and computational comparison of the two techniques for two common classes of time integrators: linear multistep schemes and Runge--Kutta schemes. We present a number of new findings, including conditions under which the LSPG ROM has a time-continuous representation, conditions under which the two techniques are equivalent, and time-discrete error bounds for the two approaches. Perhaps most surprisingly, we demonstrate both theoretically and computationally that decreasing the time step does not necessarily decrease the error for the LSPG ROM; instead, the time step should be `matched' to the spectral content of the reduced basis. In numerical experiments carried out on a turbulent compressible-flow problem with over one million unknowns, we show that increasing the time step to an intermediate value decreases both the error and the simulation time of the LSPG reduced-order model by an order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {This paper presents reduced order modelling (ROM) in fluid\textendash structure interaction (FSI). The ROM via the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method has been chosen, due to its efficiency in the domain of fluid mechanics. POD-ROM is based on a low-order dynamical system obtained by projecting the nonlinear Navier\textendash Stokes equations on a smaller number of POD modes. These POD modes are spatial and temporally independent. In FSI, the fluid and structure domains are moving, owing to which the POD method cannot be applied directly to reduce the equations of each domain. This article proposes to compute the POD modes for a global velocity field (fluid and solid), and then to construct a low-order dynamical system. The structure domain can be decomposed as a rigid domain, with a finite number of degrees of freedom. This low-order dynamical system is obtained by using a multiphase method similar to the fictitious domain method. This multiphase method extends the Navier\textendash Stokes equations to the solid domain by using a penalisation method and a Lagrangian multiplier. By projecting these equations on the POD modes obtained for the global velocity field, a nonlinear low-order dynamical system is obtained and tested on a case of high Reynolds number.},

First we provide an analysis of the errors involved in solving a nonlinear ODE initial value problem using a POD reduced order model. Then we study the effects of small perturbations in the ensemble of data from which the POD reduced order model is constructed on the reduced order model. We explain why in some applications this sensitivity is a concern while in others it is not. We also provide an analysis of computational complexity of solving an ODE initial value problem and study the computational savings obtained by using a POD reduced order model. We provide several examples to illustrate our theoretical results.},
